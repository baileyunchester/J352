<p><em>Discussing the statistical and historical evidence that proves the Yankees are going all the way this year.<em></p>
<em>By: Bailey Unchester, May 8, 2025</em>
<br><br>


<p><strong>New York, New York</strong></p>
</em></em>

<p>As the most decorated American major sports franchise, the New York Yankees have found themselves in a bit of a drought since their last World Series victory in 2009. Despite posing as consistently legitimate contenders for the past few years, with lineups consisting of generational players, the Yankees just can't seem to bring the trophy back to New York. But 2025 feels different, and I'm going to tell you why.</p>


<br>

<p><strong><em>The King of New York</em></strong>

<p>The captain of the S.S. Pinstripes is undoubtably the most prominent face of this modern Yankee era. But despite coming upon his tenth year of his MLB career, people still refuse to recognize Aaron Judge as not only a Yankee great, but as a baseball great in general. I think that is absoulutely ridiculous. Judge has the stats and the consistency to classify himself as a historical great. Aaron Judge already ranks 126th in the list of MLB all-time home run leaders, which may not seem special until you realize that the majority of this list does not consist of active players. He is keeping up with players who recorded 20+ year careers, while still having plenty of more seasons to give. Judge holds two American League MVPs, a Silver Slugger, and a Rookie of the Year title, adding to his legacy and the already full Yankees trophy shelf.</p>

<p><em><strong>Taking a Strike</em></strong></p>
</em>

<p>If you're a Yankee fan, I apologize in advance for bringing up the incident known as the 2024 World Series. But in my eyes, this means that the Yankees now know exactly what they need to do to make it to the big dance, and it's looking like they can make it there again. It's only May, but the Yankees are leading in the American League East by a steady 2.5 games as of May 8, 2025, and have been maintaining that lead for this first stretch of the season. Basically, the AL East is not looking too hot this year, and that is an easy way for the Bronx Bombers to cash in an easy playoff berth. Boston can't field ground balls to save their lives, Toronto ranks last in the MLB in home runs hit (everyone knows 2025 is the year of the long-ball), Baltimore suddenly thinks it's 2019 again, and Tampa is... well... Tampa. Once the Yanks clinch the AL East, it should be smooth sailing from there.</p>

<p><em></strong>Getting Nerdy</em></stong></p>

<p>If my personal opinions and anecdotes aren't swaying you, I'll give you some cold, hard stats instead. As of today, the Yankees have an 89.4% chance of making the playoffs. Their chances to win the division are 71.7%, and they have a 25.4% of making the World Series according to <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/mlb/team/new-york-yankees/projections">Team Rankings</a>. All in all, they have a 11.5% chance to win it all, only ranking behind the Dodgers and the Mets. An 11.5% chance of a World Series doesnt seem too shabby when being compared to 29 other MLB teams.</p>
